# NoC
Network on Chip design in VHDL


To load the complete NoC in modelsim, simply change directory to this directory and then run "do testbench.do".
This will automatically compile and simulate the design.

A specific testbench to each component is also provided.


For implementation look in the implementation folder. Here all files needed are provided aswell as a small client program, with which the network connections can be tested.
